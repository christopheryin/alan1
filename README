I'll write up a more detailed explanation of the code later, and clean up my commenting. For now though, I think the only parameter you'll need to adjust is the t_dead field in the alan1.h file.

In order for this code to compile you'll need to install the Button library. 

1) You can download the Button library as a zip folder from this link: https://github.com/tigoe/Button

2) You need to find where Arduino is installed on your computer and move the Button zip folder to the Libraries directory w/ your Arduino folder.

3) Open up an Arduino window and go to Sketch/Add .ZIP Library. Find your Button zip and select.

4) That should be all you need. If you get compile errors then try erasing the line at the beginning of alan1.h that reads "#include <Button.h>" then go to Sketch/Include Library and select Button.h from the dropdown menu, it should appear as an option at this point.

5) You'll also need to install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library. That should be included in the link you sent me from the LCD company.
